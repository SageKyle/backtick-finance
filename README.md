## Overview

### The challenge

My initial goal for this project was to test my knowledge of CSS styling and grid layout. I've spent a relatively long time learning CSS, so my goal is to see what I can actually build with CSS by cloning a well-designed website that uses a somewhat complex grid system without watching tutorials. 

Although I can't call myself a designer or even a CSS professional, I can now say that I know CSS effectively.
